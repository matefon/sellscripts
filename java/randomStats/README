How to use:

-Download the 2 files and run randomStats.java
-It will generate 10000 random number from 1 to 10 by default and save them to the text file (existing data will be overwritten!).
-It will automatically count the numbers

How to specify the amount of numbers to generate:

-In line 10 ("int forNumber = 100000;"), change 10000 to another value. Then it will generate the specified amount of numbers but still 1 to 10.

How to specify the numbers to generate:

-In line 9 ("int maxNum = 10;"), change 10 to another value. (e.g. 20)
-From now the Java program will generate random numbers between 1 and the number you entered. (e.g. 1 to 20)

Have fun!
